## Version controll

- branching strategy: single branch only
- **!Attention!**: Workpackets seperation very importand, features at best isolated from each other developable

## TODO

- what if non Relational DB is asked -> MongoDB but how (Lukas)

## Lessons Learned
- Color Pallete very useful, Pre Style Guide to just build pages with predefined components
- Early low fidelity Mockups very useful to get everyone on the same page -> UI
- Early DB Schema very useful, to get everyone on the same page -> Data
- Early Adaption of API endpoints for database, to see early issues in DB Schema
- structure of project (folders, ...) good, but more detailed better
- Good naming importand and did that aswell - very happy :)
- 13 Hours Max per Day (Human limit)
- Good Management is essential, communication
- Independent working, good work package seperation - constant communication
- SQLalchemy good, better than expected
- FastAPI very good can use again. Espeically /docs endpoint
- uv (python venv manager) - very good, use again
- Component based JS frontend framework very good (React rather than Angular), good statement management, good integration of API's
- TS good keep (if experience is there) else fallback to JS
